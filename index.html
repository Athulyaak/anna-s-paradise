			<h2> Welcome!</h2>
			<p>I have built this website from scratch while learning <b>Web Development</b> course offered by <b>University of Michigan</b> through <b>Coursera</b> during the COVID-19 pandemic. The people all over the world was hit by this pandemic induced lockdown and many started doing the things thay had saved for later. Dalonga Coffee challenge, learning to cook favorite dishes, reading books etc were done by people to throw boredom out. Likewise, I thought about learning Web Development. I found this course on Coursera and cherished a dream of  mine to build a website. So,here it is, my website!</p>
			<p>The course instructor, Colleen van Lent PhD was so good in explaining the concepts that I decided to build one and started building this website since <b>August 2020</b>, along with taking the course. I learned <b>HTML5</b>, <b>CSS3</b>, <b>Javascript</b> and <b>Responsive Design</b>. She has stressed enough on accessibility that this website complies with it and has been validated using <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C Validator</a>. I've specifically stayed away from using Bootstrap so that the content and styling remains separate. The site is best viewed on large screen. The site is made  responsive (using fluid measurements) and responsive to print using media queries <code>@media</code>.</p>
			<h2>Para-Dice</h2>
			<p>Anna's  Paradise is a sample website created using HTML, CSS & Javascript. It's just for representational purpose and I want you to enjoy playing around with these webpages as much as I did making this. So, what's with this Para-Dice thing? I simply wanted to mispell it. 'Para' is a word, for me, associated with Chemistry (Don't worry, it might have other associations too and what you just thought lies there!) and 'Dice' is a simple D-I-C-E, you play with it. This is word pun!</p>
			<p>Now, what's in here? Well, that's pretty much simple to say, you can navigate to food, nature, table and form. They contain some really cool pictures & a few paragraphs. Go through them and have a good time!</p>
			<p>Now, just for informational purpose, I have included an abbreviated term, <abbr title = "International Olympic Committee">IOC</abbr>. Happy learning! </p>
