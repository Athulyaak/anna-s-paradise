		<h2>Prawns</h2>
		<p>When I started cooking, one of my favorite dishes to make was anything but with "Prawns"! I simply loved making popcorn with them. Did you know that it can be used as an evening snack? Well, it's yummy! I'd recommend it to anyone who loves to have prawns as an evening snack. I'm stressing on evening snack because it doesn't go well with rice.</p>
		<p>Apart from Prawns Popcorn, I made Prawns Fies. They too are excellent. Just make sure that you mix all the powders in it well & keep it like that for say, 30 mins. Then, everything will be absorbed by the prawns well & it will also be tastier. Also, add how much ever of ginger-garlic paste you want. It's good that way.</p>
		<p>Then, there is this Prawns curry with coconut milk. That's the best. Try it, it's delicious!</p>
		<h2>Yoghurt</h2>
		<p> Yogurt, also spelled yoghurt, yogourt or yoghourt, is a food produced by bacterial fermentation of milk. The bacteria used to make yogurt are known as yogurt cultures. The fermentation of lactose by these bacteria produces lactic acid, which acts on milk protein to give yogurt its texture and characteristic tart flavor. Cow's milk is commonly available worldwide and, as such, is the milk most commonly used to make yogurt. Milk from water buffalo, goats, ewes, mares, camels, and yaks is also used to produce yogurt where available locally. The milk used may be homogenized or not. It may be pasteurized or raw. Each type of milk produces substantially different results. </p>
